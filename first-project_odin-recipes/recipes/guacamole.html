    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      The secret to amazing guacamole is using fresh, ripe ingredients. Don't be
      tempted to add fillers like sour cream!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Avocados:</strong> Ripe Hass avocados are the star of the show.
        They should yield to gentle pressure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion: </strong>Finely diced red or white onion adds a sharp,
        crunchy texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cilantro: </strong>Fresh cilantro leaves provide a bright,
        citrusy flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jalapeño: </strong>For a little bit of heat. Mince it finely and
        remove the seeds for less spice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lime Juice: </strong>Freshly squeezed lime juice is essential.
        It adds acidity and prevents the avocados from browning.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Garlic: </strong>A clove of minced garlic adds depth.</li>
      <li><strong>Salt: </strong>To enhance all the other flavors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make Guacamole Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>
      Making guacamole is simple. The key is to gently mix, not over-mash, the
      ingredients.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a
        medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently mash the avocado with a fork. Leave it a little chunky for better
        texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced onion, chopped cilantro, minced jalapeño, minced garlic,
        and lime juice to the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with salt and stir everything together gently until just
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Add more lime juice or salt as
        desired.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately with your favorite tortilla chips.</li>
    </ol>
