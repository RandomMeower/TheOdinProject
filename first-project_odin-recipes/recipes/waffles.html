    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      You probably have most of these simple pantry staples on hand already.
      Separating the eggs is the secret to a fluffy texture.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour provides the structure for the
        waffles.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Sugar and Salt: </strong>For flavor and balance.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking Powder: </strong>This is the leavening agent that makes
        the waffles rise and become fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs: </strong>Separating the yolks and whites is key. The
        beaten egg whites are folded in at the end to make the waffles light.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Milk: </strong>Provides moisture and richness to the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Butter: </strong>Melted butter adds flavor and helps create a
        tender crumb.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vanilla Extract: </strong>A splash of vanilla for a warm,
        aromatic flavor.
      </li>
    </ul>
