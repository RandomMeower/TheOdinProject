    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      The key to a great carbonara is using high-quality ingredients. Here’s
      what you’ll need to create this authentic dish:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pasta:</strong> Spaghetti is traditional, but you can use
        fettuccine, bucatini, or rigatoni.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pancetta:</strong> Diced pancetta provides a salty, rich flavor.
        Guanciale (cured pork jowl) is the most authentic choice if you can find
        it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs: </strong>Fresh, high-quality large eggs are crucial for
        the creamy sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese: </strong>Finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese gives the
        sauce its signature salty and sharp flavor. You can substitute with
        Parmesan if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garlic: </strong>A couple of cloves, lightly smashed, to infuse
        the oil with flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Black Pepper: </strong>Freshly cracked black pepper is essential
        for the final touch of heat.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make Carbonara Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>
      Here's a brief overview of how to bring this classic Italian dish to your
      table:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil the spaghetti in generously salted water until al dente.</li>
      <li>
        While the pasta cooks, fry the pancetta in a large skillet until crisp.
        Add garlic for the last minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated cheese, and a
        generous amount of black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Drain the pasta, reserving some of the starchy pasta water.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from the heat, and quickly toss the hot pasta with
        the pancetta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing quickly to coat.
        The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.
        Add a splash of pasta water if it seems too thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, topped with more grated cheese and black pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
